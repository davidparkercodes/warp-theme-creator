# Development Plan for Warp Theme Creator

## Project Overview
This tool will extract colors from websites to automatically generate Warp terminal themes. The user will provide a URL, and the tool will analyze the website's color scheme to create a custom theme for the Warp terminal.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Core Functionality**: Website color extraction and theme generation
- **Output Format**: YAML files compatible with Warp's theme system

## Theme Structure Analysis
After examining the Warp themes repository, we've identified the following key components:

1. **Theme Organization**:
   - Standard themes (basic color scheme themes)
   - Base16 themes (follow @chriskempson's base16 framework)
   - Special edition themes (with background images)
   - Warp bundled themes (pre-installed with Warp)

2. **Theme Format**:
   - YAML structure with required fields
   - Core colors: accent, background, foreground
   - Terminal colors: 8 normal colors + 8 bright colors
   - Optional background image with opacity setting
   - Support for gradient backgrounds and accents

3. **Preview Generation**:
   - Python script to generate SVG previews
   - Automatically updates README files

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Research (Week 1)
1. Initialize Python project structure
2. Set up virtual environment and dependencies
3. Research and select libraries for:
   - HTTP requests (requests)
   - HTML/CSS parsing (BeautifulSoup, cssutils)
   - Image processing (Pillow)
   - Color analysis (colorthief, colormath)
   - YAML handling (PyYAML)
4. Study color extraction techniques and algorithms

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Weeks 2-3)
1. Implement website fetching module
   - Handle different URL formats
   - Manage network errors and timeouts
   - Support authentication if needed
2. Create color extraction module
   - Extract dominant colors from website
   - Identify background, foreground, and accent colors
   - Generate complementary terminal colors
   - Support different extraction strategies (CSS, images, or both)
3. Implement theme generation module
   - Convert extracted colors to Warp theme format
   - Generate YAML output
   - Validate against Warp theme schema

### Phase 3: User Experience (Week 4)
1. Develop CLI interface with argparse or click
   - URL input
   - Theme customization options
   - Output location configuration
2. Add configuration options
   - Color adjustment (brightness, saturation)
   - Background image extraction and processing
   - Theme naming and metadata
3. Implement preview generation
   - Leverage existing Warp SVG preview generation
   - Provide terminal command to install the theme

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Week 5)
1. Unit tests with pytest
2. Integration tests with sample websites
3. Validation tests with Warp terminal
4. Performance testing and optimization

### Phase 5: Documentation & Distribution (Week 6)
1. Create comprehensive documentation
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration options
2. Add sample themes and previews
3. Package for distribution
   - PyPI package
   - Binary releases with PyInstaller
4. Create contribution guidelines

## Features Roadmap

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Extract colors from a website URL
- Generate a basic Warp theme YAML file
- CLI interface for basic operations

### Version 1.0
- Extract colors from both CSS and images
- Support custom color adjustments
- Include background image extraction
- Generate SVG previews

### Future Enhancements
- GUI interface
- Integration with Warp as a plugin
- Theme sharing platform
- AI-enhanced color harmony

## Development Approach
We'll follow the Python best practices outlined in UPDATE_RULES.md:
- TDD approach with tests written first
- Pure functions where possible
- Proper error handling with try/except
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Regular code quality checks with black, flake8, and mypy
