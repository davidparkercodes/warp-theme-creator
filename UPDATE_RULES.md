# Development Rules for hiredavidparker

## Workflow

-   Always create feature branches for new work
-   Make atomic, well-described, but single line commits
-   Create pull requests for code review before merging to main
-   Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
-   NEVER include authorship or generated by in commit messages or PR descriptions
-   NEVER include "Generated with..." in commit messages or PR descriptions

## Code Quality

-   Follow Clean Code principles
-   Write self-documenting code that expresses intent clearly
-   NEVER add any double forward slash // comments, except in test files
-   Avoid unnecessary comments; use comments only to explain "why" not "what"
-   Use descriptive variable and function names
-   Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
-   Maintain consistent code style across the codebase

## Testing

-   Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices
-   Write tests before implementing functionality
-   Always add both unit and integration tests for new features
-   Maintain high test coverage
-   Ensure all tests pass before submitting PRs

## Python Best Practices

-   Follow PEP 8 style guide
-   Use type hints for better code clarity
-   Implement proper error handling with try/except
-   Keep functions pure when possible
-   Utilize virtual environments for dependency management
-   Run tools like black, flake8, and mypy for code quality

## Documentation
